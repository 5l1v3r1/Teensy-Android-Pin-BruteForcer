# Teensy-Pin-BruteForcer

a BruterForcer for Teensy, works with 4 and 5 digit pins, tested on Android 4.4.2. and Teensy 2.0, but it works on any kind of Teensy, it does not work on new versions of android with temporal blocks that increase according to the attempts.

Although now the Android versions tested are obsolete, in my daily experience as a technician I often fall into old models which require me to bypass the pin.
Needless to say, the manual operation is boring at best, and not feasible in most ...
Although I have to say that I manually solved about one in five cases, simply using the list of the most used pin or screen lock that you can find here:

However, I decided to make this simple code to automate a very boring process ...
